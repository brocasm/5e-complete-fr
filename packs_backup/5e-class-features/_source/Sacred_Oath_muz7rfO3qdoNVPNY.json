      "value": "<p>When you reach 3rd level, you swear the oath that binds you as a paladin forever. Up to this time you have been in a preparatory stage, committed to the path but not yet sworn to it. Now you choose an oath, such as the Oath of Devotion.</p><p>Your choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 15th, and 20th level. Those features include oath spells and the Channel Divinity feature.</p><h3>Sacred Oaths</h3><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.cN9WFdPHjOnbmuTH]{Oath of the Ancients}</p><p>Sometimes called fey knights, green knights, or horned knights, paladins who swear this oath cast their lot with the side of the light in the cosmic struggle against darkness because they love the beautiful and life-giving things of the world.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.v0OLXxmrO2PWGHk2]{Oath of Conquest}</p><p>The Oath of Conquest calls to paladins who seek glory in battle and the subjugation of their enemies. It isn’t enough for these paladins to establish order. They must crush the forces of chaos.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.Jchphy4yjvvpS3eJ]{Oath of the Crown}</p><p>The Oath of the Crown is sworn to the ideals of civilization, be it the spirit of a nation, fealty to a sovereign, or service to a deity of law and rulership. The paladins who swear this oath dedicate themselves to serving society and, in particular, the just laws that hold society together.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.wmyrVkDoPgTbzVhm]{Oath of Devotion}</p><p>The Oath of Devotion binds a paladin to the loftiest ideals of justice, virtue, and order. Sometimes called cavaliers, white knights, or holy warriors, these paladins meet the ideal of the knight in shining armor, acting with honor in pursuit of justice and the greater good.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.fLjrMUMXScQ0OJ8v]{Oath of Glory}</p><p>Paladins who take the Oath of Glory believe they and their companions are destined to achieve glory through deeds of heroism. They train diligently and encourage their companions so they're all ready when destiny calls.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.KgfPgmoIbpz6F3Cc]{Oath of Redemption}</p><p>The Oath of Redemption sets a paladin on a difficult path, one that requires a holy warrior to use violence only as a last resort. Paladins who dedicate themselves to this oath believe that any person can be redeemed and that the path of benevolence and justice is one that anyone can walk.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.DMcVZ2raMZ8yXthn]{Oath of Vengeance}</p><p>The Oath of Vengeance is a solemn commitment to punish those who have committed a grievous sin. To these paladins – sometimes called avengers or dark knights – their own purity is not as important as delivering justice.</p><hr /><p>@UUID[Compendium.5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.Uade8LQBmy8ULy22]{Oath of the Watchers}</p><p>The Oath of the Watchers binds paladins to protect mortal realms from the predations of extraplanar creatures, many of which can lay waste to mortal soldiers. Thus, the Watchers hone their minds, spirits, and bodies to be the ultimate weapons against such threats.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.jqLzqrz5fyL3kj2M]{Oathbreaker}</p><p>An oathbreaker is a paladin who breaks their sacred oaths to pursue some dark ambition or serve an evil power. Whatever light burned in the paladin's heart been extinguished. Only darkness remains.</p><hr /><h3>Oath Spells</h3><p>Each oath has a list of associated spells. You gain access to these spells at the levels specified in the oath description. Once you gain access to an oath spell, you always have it prepared. Oath spells don’t count against the number of spells you can prepare each day.</p><p>If you gain an oath spell that doesn't appear on the paladin spell list, the spell is nonetheless a paladin spell for you.</p><h3>Channel Divinity</h3><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-class-features.BdhVFmTGhjLm1Ceo]{Channel Divinity}</p>",
