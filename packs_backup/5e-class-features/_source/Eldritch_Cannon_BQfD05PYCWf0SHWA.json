A Small eldritch cannon occupies its space, and a Tiny one can be held in one hand. Once you create a cannon, you can't do so again until you finish a <strong>long rest</strong> or until you expend a spell slot to create one. You can have only one cannon at a time and can't create one while your cannon is present.</p>\n<p>The cannon is a magical object. Regardless of size, the cannon has an AC of 18 and a number of hit points equal to five times your artificer level. It is <strong>immune </strong>to <strong>poison damage</strong> and <strong>psychic damage</strong>. If it is forced to make an ability check or a saving throw, treat all its ability scores as 10 (+0). If the mending spell is cast on it, it regains 2d6 hit points. It disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points or after 1 hour. You can dismiss it early as an action.</p>\n<p>When you create the cannon, you determine its appearance and whether it has legs. You also decide which type it is, choosing from the options on the Eldritch Cannons table. On each of your turns, you can take a bonus action to cause the cannon to activate if you are within 60 feet of it. As part of the same bonus action, you can direct the cannon to walk or climb up to 15 feet to an unoccupied space, provided it has legs.</p>\n</blockquote>\n</details><details>\n<summary style=\"padding-bottom:8px\"><strong>Eldritch Cannons</strong></summary>\n<blockquote style=\"font-style:normal\">\n<table style=\"width:100%\" border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:24.5539%\">Cannon</td>\n<td style=\"width:75.4461%\">Activation</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td style=\"width:24.5539%\">Flamethrower</td>\n<td style=\"width:75.4461%\">The cannon exhales fire in an adjacent 15-foot cone that you designate.
