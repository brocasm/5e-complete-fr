      "value": "<p>Hailing from a strange and distant land, wandering tabaxi are catlike humanoids driven by curiosity to collect interesting artifacts, gather tales and stories, and lay eyes on all the world's wonders. Ultimate travelers, the inquisitive tabaxi rarely stay in one place for long. Their innate nature pushes them to leave no secrets uncovered, no treasures or legends lost.</p><p><em><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong></em> Your Dexterity score increases by 2, and your Charisma score increases by 1.</p><p><em><strong>Languages.</strong></em> You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.</p><p><em><strong>Size.</strong></em> Tabaxi are taller on average than humans and relatively slender. Your size is Medium.</p><p><em><strong>Speed.</strong></em> Your base walking speed is 30 feet.</p><p><em><strong>Darkvision.</strong></em> You have a cat's keen senses, especially in the dark. You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p><p><em><strong>Feline Agility.</strong></em> Your reflexes and agility allow you to move with a burst of speed. When you move on your turn in combat, you can double your speed until the end of the turn. Once you use this trait, you can't use it again until you move 0 feet on one of your turns.</p><p><em><strong>Cat's Claws.</strong></em> Because of your claws, you have a climbing speed of 20 feet. In addition, your claws are natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit with them, you deal slashing damage equal to 1d4 + your Strength modifier, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.</p><p><em><strong>Cat's Talent.</strong></em> You have proficiency in the Perception and Stealth skills.</p><p></p>",
