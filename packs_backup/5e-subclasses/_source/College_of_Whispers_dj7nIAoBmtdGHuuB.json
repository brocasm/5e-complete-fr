      "value": "<p>Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.</p>\n<p>Many other bards hate the College of Whispers, viewing it as a parasite that uses the bardsâ€™ reputation to acquire wealth and power. For this reason, these bards rarely reveal their true nature unless they must. They typically claim to follow some other college, or keep their true nature secret in order to better infiltrate and exploit royal courts and other settings of power.</p>\n<h3>College of Whispers Features</h3>\n<p>3rd Level: @Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-class-features.KeLEO0ZFRNPQu2TP]{Psychic Blades}, @Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-class-features.4P8jbJqCdPuaCx5W]{Words of Terror}</p>\n<p>6th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-class-features.yJXK5MCfmL7nRDnO]{Mantle of Whispers}</p>\n<p>14th Level: @Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-class-features.TQbj8E5uObqtaQnH]{Shadow Lore}</p>",
