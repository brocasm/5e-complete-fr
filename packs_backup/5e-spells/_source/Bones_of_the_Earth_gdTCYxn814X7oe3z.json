      "value": "<div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><p>You cause up to six pillars of stone to burst from places on the ground that you can see within range. Each pillar is a cylinder that has a diameter of 5 feet and a height of up to 30 feet. The ground where a pillar appears must be wide enough for its diameter, and you can target the ground under a creature if that creature is Medium or smaller. Each pillar has AC 5 and 30 hit points. When reduced to 0 hit points, a pillar crumbles into rubble, which creates an area of difficult terrain with a 10-foot radius that lasts until the rubble is cleared. Each 5-foot-diameter portion of the area requires at least 1 minute to clear by hand.</p><p>If a pillar is created under a creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or be lifted by the pillar. A creature can choose to fail the save.</p><p>If a pillar is prevented from reaching its full height because of a ceiling or other obstacle, a creature on the pillar takes [[/r 6d6]] bludgeoning damage and is <strong>restrained</strong>, pinched between the pillar and the obstacle. The restrained creature can use an action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (the creature's choice) against the spell's save DC. On a success, the creature is no longer restrained and must either move off the pillar or fall off it.</p></div><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><div class=\"rd__b  rd__b--3\"><h3><span class=\"entry-title-inner\">At Higher Levels</span></h3><p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, you can create two additional pillars for each slot level above 6th.</p><p><strong>Spell Lists.</strong> @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete-fr.5e-journals.7iH4qANs2gxn0MIs.JournalEntryPage.1IHQ3bZ4aCi15dlH]{Druid}</p></div></div>",
