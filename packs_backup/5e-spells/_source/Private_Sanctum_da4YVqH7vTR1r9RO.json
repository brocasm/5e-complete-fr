      "value": "<p>You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it.</p><p>When you cast the spell, you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the following properties:</p><ul><li><p>Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge of the warded area.</p></li><li><p>The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy, preventing vision (including darkvision) through it.</p></li><li><p>Sensors created by divination spells can't appear inside the protected area or pass through the barrier at its perimeter.</p></li><li><p>Creatures in the area can't be targeted by divination spells.</p></li><li><p>Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.</p></li><li><p>Planar travel is blocked within the warded area.</p></li></ul><p>Casting this spell on the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent.</p><h3>At Higher Levels</h3><p>When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side by using a spell slot of 5th level.</p><p><strong>Spell Lists.</strong> Wizard</p>",
