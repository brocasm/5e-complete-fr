      "value": "<p>A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range. You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path along the ground. The wall lasts for the Duration.</p>\n        <p>When the wall appears, each creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes 3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.</p>\n        <p>The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller flying creatures or objects⁠ can’t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows⁠, bolts, and other ordinary projectiles launched at targets⁠ behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically miss. (Boulders hurled by Giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are unaffected.) Creatures in g⁠aseous form can’t pass through it.</p>",
