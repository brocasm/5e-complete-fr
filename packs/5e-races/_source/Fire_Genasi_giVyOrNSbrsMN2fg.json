      "value": "<p>Descended from efreet, the genies of the Elemental Plane of Fire, fire genasi channel the flamboyant and often destructive nature of flame. They show their heritage in their skin tones, which can range from deep charcoal to shades of red and orange. Some bear skin rones common to humanity but with fiery marks, such as slowly swirling lights under their skin that resemble embers or glowing red lines tracing over their bodies like cracks. Fire genasi hair can resemble threads of fire or sooty smoke.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language.</p>\n<p><strong>Creature Type.</strong> You are a Humanoid.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small.
