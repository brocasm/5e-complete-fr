      "value": "<p>Whether descended from a celestial being or infused with heavenly power, aasimar are mortals who carry a spark of the Upper Planes within their souls. They can fan fan that spark to bring light, ease wounds, and unleash the fury of the heavens.</p>\n<p>Aasimar can arise among any population of mortals. They resemble their parents, but they live for up to 160 years and often have features that hint at their celestial heritage. These often begin subtle and become more obvious when the assimar gains the ability to reveal their full celestial nature. The Aasimar Celestial Features table has examples you can choose or use as inspiration to create your own.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>d6</td>\n<td>Celestial Feature</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1</td>\n<td>A dusting of metallic, white, or charcoal freckles</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>2</td>\n<td>Metallic, luminous, or dark eyes</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>3</td>\n<td>Starkly colored hair</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>4</td>\n<td>An unusual hue tinting your shadow</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5</td>\n<td>A ghostly halo crowning your head</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>6</td>\n<td>Rainbows gleaming on your skin</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<p>As an aasimar, you have the following racial traits.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase. </strong>Increase one score by 2 and increase a different score by 1, or increase three different scores by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages.</strong> Your character can speak, read, and write Common and one other language.</p>\n<p><strong>Creature Type. </strong>You are a Humanoid.Creature Type. </p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> You are Medium or Small.

You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p>\n<p><strong>Healing Hands.</strong> As an action, you can touch a creature and roll a number of d4s equal to your proficiency bonus.
