They walk hours after hatching, attain the size and development of a 10-year-old human child by the age of 3, and reach adulthood by 15. They live to be around 80.</p>\n<p><strong>Alignment.</strong> Dragonborn tend to extremes, making a conscious choice for one side or the other in the cosmic war between good and evil. Most dragonborn are good, but those who side with evil can be terrible villains.</p>\n<p><strong>Size.</strong> Dragonborn are taller and heavier than humans, standing well over 6 feet tall and averaging almost 250 pounds.

Your draconic ancestry determines the size, shape, and damage type of the exhalation.</p>\n<p>When you use your breath weapon, each creature in the area of the exhalation must make a saving throw, the type of which is determined by your draconic ancestry. The DC for this saving throw equals 8 + your Constitution modifier + your proficiency bonus. A creature takes 2d6 damage on a failed save, and half as much damage on a successful one. The damage increases to 3d6 at 6th level, 4d6 at 11th level, and 5d6 at 16th level.</p>\n<p>After you use your breath weapon, you can't use it again until you complete a short or long rest.</p>\n<p><strong>Dam</strong><strong>age </strong><strong>Resistance.</strong> You have resistance to the damage type associated with your draconic ancestry.</p>\n<p><strong>Languages. </strong>You can speak, read, and write Common and Draconic.
