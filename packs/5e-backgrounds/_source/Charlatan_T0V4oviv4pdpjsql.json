      "value": "<p>You have always had a good feeling with people. You know how to hook them, you can perceive their deepest desires after a few minutes of conversation, and with a few precise questions you can read them like an open book. It's a very useful talent, and you know exactly how to use it to your advantage.</p><p>You know what people want and you give it to them, or rather you promise to give it to them. Common sense would dictate that a person would flee from an offer that seems too good to be true, but common sense always seems to be absent when you are around. This bottle of a rosy liquid will surely cure that nasty skin eruption, this ointment (nothing more than a bit of grease sprinkled with silver dust) can restore youth and vigor, and there is a bridge in town that has just been put up for sale. These tall tales seem implausible, but you always manage to make them look like very good deals that are quite plausible.</p><hr /><p><strong>Mastered Skills:</strong> <span style=\"font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif\">Sleight of Hand, Deception</span></p><p><strong>Mastered Tools:</strong> <span style=\"font-family:Lato, Arial, sans-serif\">forgery kit, disguise kit</span></p><p><strong>Equipment:</strong> fine clothes, a disguise kit, swindler's tools of your choice (10 stoppered bottles filled with colored liquid, loaded dice, marked cards, fake duke's signet ring, ...) and a purse containing 15 gp.</p><p><strong>Feature:</strong> @Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-backgrounds.Item.LHhLGQqVk0d3Rd54]</p><hr /><p></p><h3>Suggested Personalities</h3><p>Charlatans are colorful characters who hide their true personality behind masks they craft.
