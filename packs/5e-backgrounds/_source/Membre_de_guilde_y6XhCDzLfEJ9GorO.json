      "value": "<p>As a well-established and respected member of your guild, you can count on certain advantages that your membership confers. Your guildmates will provide you with shelter and sustenance if necessary, and pay for your funeral if need be. In certain towns or cities, guilds offer a place where you can meet other members of your profession, which can be a good way to make the acquaintance of potential patrons, allies, or lackeys.</p><p>Guilds often wield significant political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if good arguments can be made to prove your innocence, or if the crime was justified. You may also have access to certain powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a high-ranking member. These introductions may, however, require that you make a donation of gold or magical item to the guild's coffers.</p><p>You must pay 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss a payment, you will have to make up your back dues to get back in the guild's good graces.</p>",
