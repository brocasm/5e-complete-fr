A human, her eyes still glowing with unearthly power, tosses a few extra coins on the bar. \"Sorry for the mess. If he wakes up, tell him to try picking on someone his own size next time\".</p><p>The prisoner's expression turns from defiant to puzzled as the interrogator asks no questions, merely stares at them silently. His puzzled expression turns worried as he finds himself, unbidden, recalling where he stashed the loot. \"Under the stables behind the Rusty Hook Inn\" the interrogator finally speaks, as the thief's expression becomes terrified.</p><p>\"Ain't you... cold or somethin'?\" the dwarf asks the elf as they trudge through the snow, eying her simple robe and bare feet. \"I just think 'warm'\" the elf replies with a distracted air. The dwarf snorts, a puff of chilled air. Typical elf nonsense. Except... they haven't frozen to death yet. \"Say... could you think some 'warm' this way?\" the dwarf asks hopefully. To the dwarf’s surprise, the chill of the snow fades away completely. \"That's downright creepy... hey don't stop now! Was jus' sayin' it was creepy.\"</p><p>Psions are those who have tapped into a special otherworldly force, with the ability to actualize the power of their mind to accomplish impossible feats. Reading minds, lifting vast weights, and transcending physical limitations, they tend to inspire awe and terror in equal measure.</p><p>The exact nature of what psionic power is might be a question answered in your setting, or it might not be. Most view psionic power as coming from within, though other answers exist - anything from the leaking power of the Far Realm, to an alternate way to express magic, to an actualization of an individual's will upon the world.</p><h2>Powerful Minds</h2><p>Since a psion's weapon is their mind, they are always a careless thought away from harming those around them. For a psion, the line between thinking and doing can be very thin, forcing them to keep their thoughts and emotions in check, lest their powers run amok. This leads to many of them developing odd behaviors or mannerisms to help them control their state of mind, frequently seeming quite eccentric to an outside observer.</p><p>Consider how your psion keeps their powers in check, and how much their power bleeds into their everyday life. How reading minds may affect their body language or habits. Do they add wood to the campfire from the comfort of their bedroll, or do they restrain themselves from using their power for trivial matters lest they slip up?</p><h2>Misunderstood Power</h2><p>In a world of widespread magic, many will assume a psion to be a type of Sorcerer or Wizard, mistaking their powers for the common applications of magic. The common villager keeps only one mental category for the supernatural and creepy people that bend reality to their will. But even among magic users, a psion's powers will frequently be found unnerving.</p><p>It is often those who do understand magic that find a psion’s abilities the most aberrant. A force that intersects the magical weave rather than obeys it, the nature of the power that the psion wields one can only contemplate with unease.</p><h3>Multiclassing</h3><p>If your group uses the optional rule on multiclassing in the Player’s Handbook, here’s what you need to know if you choose psion as one of your classes.</p><p><strong>Ability Score Minimum.</strong> As a multiclass character, you must have at least an Intelligence score of 13 to take a level in this class, or to take a level in another class if you are already a psion.</p><p><strong>Proficiencies Gained.</strong> If psion isn’t your initial class, here are the proficiencies you gain when you take your first level as a psion: light armor, simple weapons.</p><p>Please refer to the @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-journals.a5xwmx4d5X1FHEct]{Multiclassing Rules} for additional information on multiclassing.</p>",
