Although they eventually won their freedom, these grim, ashen-skinned dwarves now take slaves of their own and are as tyrannical as their former masters.</p>\n<p><strong>Ability Score Increase.</strong> Your Strength score increases by 1.</p>\n<p><strong>Superior Darkvision.</strong> You can see in dim light within 120 feet of you as if it were bright light, and in darkness as if it were dim light. You can't discern color in darkness, only shades of gray.</p>\n<p><strong>Duergar Resilience</strong><em><strong>.</strong></em> You have advantage on saving throws against illusions and against being charmed or paralyzed.</p>\n<p><strong>Duergar Magic.</strong> When you reach 3rd level, you can cast the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.2flb5JAjsIaSTMiO]{Enlarge/Reduce} spell on yourself once with this trait, using only the spell's enlarge option. When you reach 5th level, you can cast the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.ucNcJVZQ5RqyFG2e]{Invisibility} spell on yourself once with this trait. You don't need material components for either spell, and you can't cast them while you're in direct sunlight, although sunlight has no effect on them once cast. You regain the ability to cast these spells with this trait when you finish a long rest. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for these spells.</p>\n<p><strong>Sunlight Sensitivity.</strong> You have disadvantage on Attack rolls and Wisdom (Perception) checks that rely on sight when you, the target of your attack, or whatever you are trying to perceive is in direct sunlight.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Note: After adding @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.2flb5JAjsIaSTMiO]{Enlarge/Reduce} and @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.ucNcJVZQ5RqyFG2e]{Invisibility} to your character, set Preparation Mode to Innate with 1 use per Long Rest.</em></p>\n</section>",
