If the creature can understand you, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become Charmed by you for the Duration. While the creature is cha⁠rmed by you, it takes 5d10 psychic damage each time it acts in a manner directly counter to your instructions, but no more than once each day. A creature that can’t understand you is unaffected by the spell.</p>\n<p>You can issue any comm⁠and you choose, short of an activity that would result in certain death. Should you issue a suicidal comm⁠and, the spell ends.</p>\n<p>You can end the spell early by using an action to dismiss it. A Remove Curse, Greater Restoration, or wish spell also ends it.</p>\n<p><h3>At Higher Levels</h3> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th or 8th level, the Duration is 1 year. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 9th level, the spell lasts until it is ended by one of the Spells mentioned above.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Lists.</strong> Bard, Cleric, Druid, Paladin, Wizard</p>",
