You and your adventuring companions can expect to receive care and free healing in a temple, sanctuary, or other established presence of your faith, although you must provide any material components necessary for the spells. Those who share your religion will support (only you) at a modest level of living.</p>\n<p>You might also have ties to a specific temple dedicated to your chosen deity or pantheon, and you have a residence there. This could be the temple where you once served, if you remain on good terms with it, or a temple where you have found a new home. By being close to your temple, you can call upon the priests for aid, provided that the aid you request is not dangerous and that you remain on good terms with your temple.</p>",
