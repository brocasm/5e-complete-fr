Your fellow guild members will provide you with lodging and food if necessary, and pay for your funeral if need be. In some cities and towns, a guildhall offers a central location to meet with other members of your profession, which can be a good place to meet potential patrons, allies, or mercenaries.</p>\n<p>Guilds often wield considerable political power. If you are accused of a crime, your guild will support you if a good case can be made for your innocence or if the crime is justifiable. You can also gain access to powerful political figures through the guild, if you are a member in good standing. Such connections may require the donation of money or magical items to the guild's coffers.</p>\n<p>You must pay dues of 5 gp per month to the guild. If you miss payments, you must make up the back dues to stay in good standing with the guild.</p>",
