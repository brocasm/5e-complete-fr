You might sail on the ship you served on, or another ship with which you have good relations (perhaps a captain by a former shipmate). Because you are calling in a favor, you cannot be certain of a schedule or route that will meet all your needs. Your GM will determine how long it will take to get where you need to go. In return for your free passage, you and your companions are expected to help the crew during the voyage.</p>",
