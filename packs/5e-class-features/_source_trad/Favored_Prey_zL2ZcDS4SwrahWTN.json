Alternatively, you can select two races of humanoid (such as gnolls and orcs) as favored enemies. You gain a +2 bonus to damage rolls with weapon attacks against creatures of the chosen type. Additionally, you have advantage on Wisdom (Survival) checks to track your favored enemies, as well as on Intelligence checks to recall information about them.</p>\n<p>When you gain this feature, you also learn one language of your choice, typically one spoken by your favored enemy or creatures associated with it. However, you are free to pick any language you wish to learn.</p>\n<p>You choose one additional favored enemy, as well as an associated language, at 6th level.</p>",
