You also have <strong>advantage </strong>on saving throws against any disease.</p>\n<p>Additionally, <strong>undead</strong> have difficulty harming you. If an undead targets you directly with an attack or a harmful spell, that creature must make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC (an undead needn't make the save when it includes you in an area effect, such as the explosion of @Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-spells.W5tkcxQXwgeja3SN]{Fireball}). On a failed save, the creature must choose a new target or forfeit targeting someone instead of you, potentially wasting the attack or spell. On a successful save, the creature is <strong>immune</strong> to this effect for 24 hours. An undead is also immune to this effect for 24 hours if you target it with an attack or a harmful spell.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Note: After adding Spare the Dying to your character, set Preparation Mode to Always Prepared.</em></p>\n</section>",
