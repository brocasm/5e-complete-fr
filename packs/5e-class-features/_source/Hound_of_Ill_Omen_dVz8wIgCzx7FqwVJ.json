As a bonus action, you can spend 3 @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-class-features.7hAcETWHOVguR2ZF]{Sorcery Points}Â to summon a @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-creatures.Bf6AORoohkaly5E6]{Hound of Ill Omen} to target one creature you can see within 120 feet of you. The hound uses the dire wolf's statistics, with the following changes:</p>\n<p>The hound is size Medium, not Large, and it counts as a monstrosity, not a beast.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>It appears with a number of temporary hit points equal to half your sorcerer level.</li>\n<li>It can move through other creatures and objects as if they were difficult terrain. The hound takes 5 force damage if it ends its turn inside an object.</li>\n<li>At the start of its turn, the hound automatically knows its target's location. If the target was hidden, it is no longer hidden from the hound.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The hound appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of the target. Roll initiative for the hound. On its turn, it can move only toward its target by the most direct route, and it can use its action only to attack its target. The hound can make <strong>opportunity attacks</strong>, but only against its target. Additionally, while the hound is within 5 feet of the target, the target has <strong>disadvantage </strong>on saving throws against any spell you cast. The hound disappears if it is reduced to 0 hit points, if its target is reduced to 0 hit points, or after 5 minutes.</p>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Note: After adding this feature to your character, set Resource Consumption to Item Uses: Font of Magic: 3</em></p>\n<p><em>At higher sorcerer levels you will need to update the hound's temporary hit points on summon.</em></p>\n</section>",
