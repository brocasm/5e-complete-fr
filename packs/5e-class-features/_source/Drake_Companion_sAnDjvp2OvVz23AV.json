      "value": "<p>At 3rd level, as an action, you can magically summon the drake that is bound to you. It appears in an unoccupied space of your choice within 30 feet of you.</p>\n<p>The drake is friendly to you and your companions, and it obeys your commands. See its game statistics in the accompanying <strong>Drake Companion</strong> stat block, which uses your proficiency bonus (PB) in several places. Whenever you summon the drake, choose a damage type listed in its <strong>Draconic Essence</strong> trait. You can determine the cosmetic characteristics of the drake, such as its color, its scale texture, or any visible effect of its Draconic Essence; your choice has no effect on its game statistics.</p>\n<p>In combat, the drake shares your initiative count, but it takes its turn immediately after yours. It can move and use its reaction on its own, but the only action it takes on its turn is the <strong>Dodge </strong>action, unless you take a bonus action on your turn to command it to take another action. That action can be one in its stat block or some other action. If you are incapacitated, the drake can take any action of its choice, not just <strong>Dodge</strong>.</p>\n<p>The drake remains until it is reduced to 0 hit points, until you use this feature to summon the drake again, or until you die. Anything the drake was wearing or carrying is left behind when the drake vanishes.</p>\n<p>Once you summon the drake, you can’t do so again until you finish a <strong>long rest</strong>, unless you expend a <strong>spell slot of 1st level or higher</strong> to summon it.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You can use the following stat block for your companion: @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-creatures.53FCoU4Z3sPhjBlY]{Drake Companion}</p>\n<p> </p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Drake Companion</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td><em>Small dragon</em></td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Armor Class:</strong> 14 + PB (natural armor)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Hit Points:</strong> 5 + five times your ranger level (the drake has a number of hit dice [d10s] equal to your ranger level)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td><strong>Speed:</strong> 40 ft.</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>STR</td>\n<td>DEX</td>\n<td>CON</td>\n<td>INT</td>\n<td>WIS</td>\n<td>CHA</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>16 (+3)</td>\n<td>12 (+1)</td>\n<td>15 (+2)</td>\n<td>8 (-1)</td>\n<td>14 (+2)</td>\n<td>8 (-1)</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Saving Throws: </strong>Dex +1 plus PB, Wis +2 plus PB</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Damage Immunities:</strong> determined by the drake’s Draconic Essence trait</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Senses:</strong> darkvision 60 ft., passive Perception 12</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Languages:</strong> Draconic</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Challenge:</strong> Proficiency Bonus (PB) equals your bonus</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"6\"><strong>Draconic Essence.</strong> When you summon the drake, choose a damage type: acid, cold, fire, lightning, or poison.
