The archetype you choose grants you features at 3rd level and again at 7th, 10th, 15th, and 18th level.</p><h3>Martial Archetypes</h3><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.LHB9lIXTP1LvKcYr]{Arcane Archer}</p><p>An Arcane Archer studies a unique elven method of archery that weaves magic into attacks to produce supernatural effects. Arcane Archers stand watch over the fringes of elven domains, keeping a keen eye out for trespassers and using magic-infused arrows to defeat monsters and invaders before they can reach elven settlements.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.wgrHNslLKT8KpizM]{Banneret}</p><p>A banneret is a knight who inspires greatness in others by committing brave deeds in battle. A lone banneret is a skilled warrior, but a banneret leading a band of allies can transform even the most poorly equipped militia into a ferocious war band.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.bMVK3NFmtPS0gC8X]{Battle Master}</p><p>Those who emulate the archetypal Battle Master employ martial techniques passed down through generations. To a Battle Master, combat is an academic field, sometimes including subjects beyond battle such as weaponsmithing and calligraphy.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.3NetCOYfEOhQjMD9]{Cavalier}</p><p>The archetypal cavalier excels at mounted combat. Usually born among the nobility and raised at court, a cavalier is equally at home leading a cavalry charge or exchanging repartee at a state dinner.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.35U95imNp332RHgq]{Champion}</p><p>The archetypal Champion focuses on the development of raw physical power honed to deadly perfection. Those who model themselves on this archetype combine rigorous training with physical excellence to deal devastating blows.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.zIFA2Qt0eB2z61Zr]{Echo Knight}</p><p>A mysterious and feared frontline warrior of the Kryn Dynasty, the Echo Knight has mastered the art of using dunamis to summon the fading shades of unrealized timelines to aid them in battle. Surrounded by echoes of their own might, they charge into the fray as a cycling swarm of shadows and strikes.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.xujmMuByXQSax8cD]{Eldritch Knight}</p><p>The archetypal Eldritch Knight⁠⁠ combines the martial mastery common⁠ to all fighters with a careful study of magic. Eldritch Knights use magical Techniques similar to those practiced by wizards. They focus their study on two of the eight schools of magic: Abjuration and Evocation.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.eeCUxl9iCmbQfkdX]{Psi Warrior}</p><p>Awake to the psionic power within, a Psi Warrior is a fighter who augments their physical might with psi-infused weapon strikes, telekinetic lashes, and barriers of mental force.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.A2woL0vBOqZ4GwiY]{Rune Knight}</p><p>Rune Knights enhance their martial prowess using the supernatural power of runes, an ancient practice that originated with giants. Rune cutters have studied the giant's craft and learned how to apply magic runes to empower their equipment.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete.5e-subclasses.kFRKM1ptfIhDtGgz]{Samurai}</p><p>The Samurai is a fighter who draws on an implacable fighting spirit to overcome enemies. A samurai’s resolve is nearly unbreakable, and the enemies in a samurai’s path have two choices: yield or die fighting</p>",
