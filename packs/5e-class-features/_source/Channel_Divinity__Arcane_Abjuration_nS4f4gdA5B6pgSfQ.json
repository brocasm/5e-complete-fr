If the creature fails its saving throw, it is turned for 1 minute or until it takes any damage.</p>\n<p>A turned creature must spend its turns trying to move as far away from you as it can, and it can't willingly end its move in a space within 30 feet of you. It also can't take <strong>reactions</strong>. For its action, it can only use the <strong>Dash </strong>action or try to escape from an effect that prevents it from moving. If there's nowhere to move, the creature can use the <strong>Dodge </strong>action.</p>\n<p>After you reach 5th level, when a creature fails its saving throw against your Arcane Abjuration feature, the creature is banished for 1 minute (as in the @Compendium[5e-complete.5e-spells.NtdmlSBrs1mCCgQi]{Banishment} spell, no concentration required) if it isn't on its plane of origin and its challenge rating is at or below a certain threshold, as shown on the Arcane Banishment table.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td>Cleric Level</td>\n<td>Banishes Creatures of CR...</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>1/2 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>8th</td>\n<td>1 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>11th</td>\n<td>2 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>14th</td>\n<td>3 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>4 or lower</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<section class=\"secret\">\n<p><em>Note: When you add this feature to your character, set Resource Consumption to Item Uses: Channel Divinity.</em></p>\n</section>",
