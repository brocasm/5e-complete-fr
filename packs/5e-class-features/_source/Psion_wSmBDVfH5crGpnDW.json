Archetypes</h1>\n<h2>Awakened Mind</h2>\n<p>An Awakened Mind is a psion who had their psionic power awakened within them by an encounter, event, or circumstance. Perhaps their powers were latent or perhaps their destiny had been that of a normal creature until powers were suddenly thrust on them. Perhaps they brushed the Far Realm in a vivid dream, perhaps they wandered the Feywild and came back warped, perhaps they merely glimpsed the eyes of a creature that did not belong walking down the street.</p>\n<p>An awakening is often somewhat traumatic. Psions are not well understood and the first power they manifest - telepathy - is one of the most feared and shunned abilities.</p>\n<p>An Awakened can be either empathetic or cruel, good or evil. Knowing what is on the minds of others affects people in different ways, driving some away from society as they see its true face, while others feel drawn to help the problems only they can see.</p>\n<h3>Awakened Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Unleashed Mind</h2>\n<p>An Unleashed Mind's power is most often an innate force they struggle to understand or control, a reflection of their state of mind and mood projected onto the world around them, often to devastating results. The life of an Unleashed Psion is frequently their journey to control their unruly powers... or one of embracing the destructive powers fully.</p>\n<p>What the wellspring of their innate power is varies - they could be a psionic race, born under the influence of distant twisted powers, warped by fey blood, or a herald of something more sinister brushing against the material world. Sometimes their power will show itself in simple applications, but most often their power becomes known and feared when their temper flares.</p>\n<p>Their alignment frequently depends on the approach to their powers they have taken, an Unleashed Psion who emphasizes control and restraint, keeping their emotions from running wild and their powers from running rampany will most often be lawful, following strict personal codes. On the other hand, an Unleashed Psion who lets their power run rampant will almost always be chaotic in nature, acting on impulse... with great emphasis.</p>\n<h3>Unleashed Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Transcended Mind</h2>\n<p>A Transcended psion is most often one that ahs found their path to psionic powers through a mental epiphany, realizing the place of their mind within the multiverse and how it ties to everything else, seeing the keys and levers to the world laid out before them in their mind's eye.</p>\n<p>Most often achieved either intentionally or accidentally through meditation and ritual, this can sometimes even be a passed on technique to reliably transcend the strictly material concerns, and explore the more cognitive realm and powers within.</p>\n<p>Transcended psions tend to have the best grasp on their powers in control and principle, having come ot understand the greater cosmos, but lack the reckless abandon some other psions may have. Unfortunately, less transcendent minds frequently cannot understand the greater truths they have learned and may view a Trasncended psion as a bit... peculiar.</p>\n<h3>Transcended Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Shaper's Mind</h2>\n<p>An Shaper is a psion that specializes in the materialization of their imagination, projecting it out into the world. No mere conjurers borrowing the powers of other planes, a Shaper manifests things from nothing but their own mind, weaving their creations into existence through the exertion of raw psionic power and imagination.</p>\n<p>A Shaper's mind is a tool of nearly unrivaled power possessing both boundless creativity and inexorable will, but if that will is overrun, the world would do well to fear a Shaper's nightmares.</p>\n<h3>Shaper's Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Wandering Mind</h2>\n<p>An Wandering Mind is among the mroe mysterious incarnates of psions, these are individuals that just aren't quite rooted in the same reality everyone else is... they find it more pliable and slippery, and prone to jumping right through it on occasion.</p>\n<p>How they get their powers varies. Some were born in the ethereal plane or went through a portal while young. Sometimes it is just that their mind just works along an axis most people cannot understand. No matter its source, they manifest a truly unique ability to treat certain aspects of the metaphysical with a certain mundanity, and are prone to treating their powers as absolutely natural things as one might treat an arm or a leg.</p>\n<h3>Wandering Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Elemental Mind</h2>\n<h3>Elemental Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>Consuming Mind</h2>\n<p>A dangerous branch of psionics that are born from the ability to sap energy from other creatures, tearing from them their thoughts, their mind, and ultimately their vitality for your own consumption. A feared branch of power, it is often believed to be one of the ancientprimeval roots of psionic power as it is a branch of power found most often the most ancient and terrible of the practitioners of psionics, such as brain-eating squad-faced monsters and ancient psionic space whales, which might have other names in various settings.</p>\n<p>It has been refined by those that seek greater pwoer either from ambition or desperation, and unlocks a terrible but effective path. One example of mortal creatures walking this path is the houses of dark elves, who developed their dark pwoers from their study of feral vampiric brain-eating monsters.</p>\n<h3>Consuming Mind Features</h3>\n<p>1st Level: </p>\n<p>3rd Level: </p>\n<p>6th Level: </p>\n<p>10th Level: </p>\n<p>14th Level: </p>",
