This die changes as you gain monk levels, as shown in the Martial Arts column of the Monk table.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>When you use the Attack action with an unarmed strike or a monk weapon on your turn, you can make one unarmed strike as a bonus action. For example, if you take the Attack action and attack with a quarterstaff, you can also make an unarmed strike as a bonus action, assuming you haven't already taken a bonus action this turn.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Certain monasteries use specialized forms of the monk weapons. For example, you might use a club that is two lengths of wood connected by a short chain (called a nunchaku) or a sickle with a shorter, straighter blade (called a kama). Whatever name you use for a monk weapon, you can use the game statistics provided for the weapon.</p>\n<table border=\"1\">\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<td colspan=\"2\">Martial Arts Die</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>Monk Level</td>\n<td>Die Type</td>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>1st</td>\n<td>1d4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>5th</td>\n<td>1d6</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>12th</td>\n<td>1d8</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>17th</td>\n<td>1d10</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>",
