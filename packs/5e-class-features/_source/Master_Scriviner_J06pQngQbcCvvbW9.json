      "value": "<p>At 10th level, whenever you finish a long rest, you can create one magic scroll by touching your @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.QQjetarrqYAUFGSH]{Wizardly Quill} to a blank piece of paper or parchment and causing one spell from your @UUID[Compendium.5e-complete.5e-class-features.2jHeIzhtZdDFes9d]{Awakened Spellbook} to be copied onto the scroll. The spellbook must be within 5 feet of you when you make the scroll.</p><p>The chosen spell must be of 1st or 2nd level and must have a casting time of 1 action. Once in the scroll, the spell's power is enhanced, counting as one level higher than normal. You can cast the spell from the scroll by reading it as an action. The scroll is unintelligible to anyone else, and the spell vanishes from the scroll when you cast it or when you finish your next long rest.</p><p>You are also adept at crafting spell scrolls, which are described in the treasure chapter of the Dungeon Master's Guide. The gold and time you must spend to make such a scroll are halved if you use your Wizardly Quill.</p>",
