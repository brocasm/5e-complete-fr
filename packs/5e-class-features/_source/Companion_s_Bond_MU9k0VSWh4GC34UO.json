      "value": "<p>You have a special bond with your animal companion, and you each gain certain benefits while linked to one another.</p><p>The animal companion loses its Multiattack action, if it has one.</p><p>The companion obeys your commands as best it can. It rolls for initiative like any other creature, but you determine its actions, decisions, attitudes, and so on. If you are incapacitated or absent, your companion acts on its own.</p><table style=\"width:98.5222%;height:32px\" border=\"1\"><thead><tr style=\"height:16px\"><td style=\"width:99%;height:16px\">Keeping Track of Proficiency</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr style=\"height:16px\"><td style=\"width:99%;height:16px\">When you gain your animal companion at 3rd level, its proficiency bonus matches yours at +2. As you gain levels and increase your proficiency bonus, remember that your companion’s proficiency bonus improves as well, and is applied to the following areas: Armor Class, all ability checks, all saving throws, attack bonus, and damage rolls.</td></tr></tbody></table><p>When using your Natural Explorer feature, you and your animal companion can both move stealthily at a normal pace.</p><p>Your animal companion has abilities and game statistics determined in part by your level. Your companion uses your proficiency bonus rather than its own. In addition to the areas where it normally uses its proficiency bonus, an animal companion also adds your proficiency bonus to its AC and to its damage rolls.</p><p>You can add your proficiency bonus to any ability check or saving throw that the beast makes.</p><p>For each hunter level you gain after 3rd, your animal companion gains an additional hit die and increases its hit points accordingly.</p><p>At hunter levels 4, 8, 12, 16, and 19. <span style=\"text-decoration:underline\"><span style=\"text-decoration:underline\">Your companion can increase one ability score of your choice by 1,</span></span> up to a maximum of 20.</p><p>Your companion shares your alignment, and has a personality trait and a flaw that you can roll for or select from the tables below. Your companion shares your ideal, and its bond is always, “The ranger who travels with me is a beloved companion for whom I would gladly give my life.”</p><table border=\"1\"><thead><tr><td>Why No Multiattack?</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Multiattack is a useful design tool that keeps monsters simple for the DM. It provides a boost in offense, but that boost is meant to make a beast threatening for one battle — a notion that doesn’t mesh well with a beast intended to fight with the party, rather than against it. Project Multiattack across an entire adventure, and an animal companion runs the risk of outclassing the fighters and barbarians in the party.</p><p>So in story terms, your animal companion has traded in some of its ferocity (in the form of Multiattack) for better awareness and the ability to fight more effectively in concert with you.</p></td></tr></tbody></table><p>Your animal companion gains the benefits of your Favored Enemy feature, and of your Greater Favored Enemy feature when you gain that feature at 6th level. It uses the favored enemies you selected for those features.</p><table style=\"width:98.5222%\" border=\"1\"><thead><tr><td style=\"width:5.52665%\">d6</td><td style=\"width:93.2234%\">Trait</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td style=\"width:5.52665%\">1</td><td style=\"width:93.2234%\">I'm dauntless in the face of adversity.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:5.52665%\">2</td><td style=\"width:93.2234%\">Threaten my friends, threaten me.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:5.52665%\">3</td><td style=\"width:93.2234%\">I stay on alert so others can rest.</td></tr><tr><td style=\"width:5.52665%\">4</td><td style=\"width:93.2234%\">People see an animal and underestimate me.

In general, that applies to creatures with a challenge rating of 1/4 or less, but there are exceptions.</td></tr></tbody></table>",
