      "value": "<p>À 3e niveau, vous choisissez un chemin qui façonne la nature de votre rage, tel que le Chemin du Berserker. Votre choix vous accorde des caractéristiques au niveau 3 et à nouveau au niveau 6, 10 et 14.</p><h3>Primal Paths</h3><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.L7nGhUTZoSRGceMe]{Path of the Ancestral Guardian}</p><p>Some barbarians hail from cultures that revere their ancestors. These tribes teach that the warriors of the past linger in the world as mighty spirits, who can guide and protect the living. When a barbarian who follows this path rages, the barbarian contacts the spirit world and calls on these guardian spirits for aid.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.OakNByt1ck7Eapki]{Path of the Battlerager}</p><p>Battleragers are dwarf followers of the gods of war and take the Path of the Battlerager. They specialize in wearing bulky, spiked armor and throwing themselves into combat, striking with their body itself and giving themselves over to the fury of battle.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.Ef1wOntKz5yxcaAf]{Path of the Beast}</p><p>Barbarians who walk the Path of the Beast draw their rage from a bestial spark burning within their souls. That beast bursts forth in the throes of rage, physically transforming the barbarian.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.n5aUYtkw7BPyzYxs]{Path of the Berserker}</p><p>For some barbarians, rage is a means to an end — that end being violence. The Path of the Berserker is a path of untrammeled fury, slick with blood. As you enter the berserker’s rage, you thrill in the chaos of battle, heedless of your own health or well-being.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.YEbtPZ3Rigmc9Xrx]{Path of the Storm Herald}</p><p>Typical barbarians harbor a fury that dwells within. Their rage grants them superior strength, durability, and speed. Barbarians who follow the Path of the Storm Herald learn instead to transform their rage into a mantle of primal magic that swirls around them. When in a fury, a barbarian of this path taps into nature to create powerful, magical effects.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.XyrvJNNSDtrw6Vu1]{Path of the Totem Warrior}</p><p>The Path of the Totem Warrior is a spiritual journey, as the barbarian accepts a spirit animal as guide, protector, and inspiration. In battle, your totem spirit fills you with supernatural might, adding magical fuel to your barbarian rage.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.oqdxPZ994Rib4HV8]{Path of Wild Magic}</p><p>Many places in the multiverse abound with beauty, intense emotion, and rampant magic; the Feywild, the Upper Planes, and other realms of supernatural power radiate with such forces and can profoundly influence people. As folk of deep feeling, barbarians are especially susceptible to these wild influences, with some barbarians being transformed by the magic.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.HeAlsQuyGiW73TW0]{Path of the Zealot Herald}</p><p>Some deities inspire their followers to pitch themselves into a ferocious battle fury. These barbarians are zealots – warriors who channel their rage into powerful displays of divine power.</p>",
