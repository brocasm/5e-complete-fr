      "value": "<p>À 3e niveau, vous vous plongez dans les techniques avancées d'un collège de bardes de votre choix. Votre choix vous accorde des caractéristiques au 3e niveau, puis à nouveau au 6e et au 14e niveau.</p><h3>Bard Colleges</h3><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.qkETIwlzL59vxAfD]{College of Creation}</p><p>Bards believe the cosmos is a work of art - the creation of the first dragons and gods. That creative work included harmonies that continue to resound through existence today, a power known as the Song of Creation.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.Xty1wcUiaHyzmgqS]{College of Eloquence}</p><p>Adherents of the College of Eloquence master the art of oratory. Persuasion is regarded as a high art, and a well-reasoned, well-spoken argument often proves more powerful than objective truth.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.Cvu1lBwsbOtNJlMb]{College of Glamour}</p><p>The bards of this college are regarded with a mixture of awe and fear. Their performances are the stuff of legend. These bards are so eloquent that a speech or song that one of them performs can cause captors to release the bard unharmed and can lull a furious dragon into complacency.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.LgqsHfQMcByHRluS]{College of Lore}</p><p>Bards of the College of Lore know something about most things, collecting bits of knowledge from sources as diverse as scholarly tomes and peasant tales. Whether singing folk ballads in taverns or elaborate compositions in royal courts, these bards use their gifts to hold audiences spellbound.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.aTsYbinSlYR8Gxos]{College of Spirits}</p><p>Bards of the College of Spirits seek tales with inherent power-be they legends, histories, or fictions-and bring their subjects to life. Using occult trappings, these bards conjure spiritual embodiments of powerful forces to change the world once more. Such spirits are capricious, though, and what a bard summons isn't always entirely under their control.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.VOKrv5nJudpJTcAK]{College of Swords}</p><p>Bards of the College of Swords are called blades, and they entertain through daring feats of weapon prowess. Blades perform stunts such as sword swallowing, knife throwing and juggling, and mock combats. Though they use their weapons to entertain, they are also highly trained and skilled warriors in their own right.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.Uolpxym0KLQPO6b0]{College of Valor}</p><p>Bards of the College of Valor are daring skalds whose tales keep alive the memory of the great heroes of the past, and thereby inspire a new generation of heroes. These bards gather in mead halls or around great bonfires to sing the deeds of the mighty, both past and present.</p><hr /><p>@Compendium[5e-complete-fr.5e-subclasses.dj7nIAoBmtdGHuuB]{College of Whispers}</p><p>Most folk are happy to welcome a bard into their midst. Bards of the College of Whispers use this to their advantage. They appear to be like any other bard, sharing news, singing songs, and telling tales to the audiences they gather. In truth, the College of Whispers teaches its students that they are wolves among sheep. These bards use their knowledge and magic to uncover secrets and turn them against others through extortion and threats.</p>",
